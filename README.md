Data Análisis con python parte II

## Typical operations for an analysis. Cleaning data, parsing data for statistical analysis, using numpy, a scientific Python library, visualizing data using the Seaborn library, dealing with outliers, and using normal distribution.

This dataset records the details and preferences of thousands of users of the StackOverflow website. Only 999 of those thousands of data are shown here.Printing the name of the columns and their type. ('so_survey.csv')

Replace NaN with 0.0
Form a category for ranges of values.
Chart to see the salary distributions in each category.
Working with missing values ​​of a categorical variable.
Working with missing values ​​of a numeric variable.
Replacing missing NaN values ​​with the mean.
Removing regular expressions from numbers.

It is important to do calculations with the normal distribution because it is widely used.
We will work on data from the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.
And we will show the heights of volleyball and basketball players. ('athlete_events.csv')

We can test for normality in many ways, but we will focus only on this visualization called the quantile-quantile or Q — Q plot. 
Examples of calculating probabilities with the normal distribution. 
The ConverterSalary column is used to apply the normal Log transformation, since the data is highly skewed to the left.

Another way to approach a skewed distribution is to use box plots, using the median and quantiles. We eliminate extreme values ​​by a quantile cutoff. We eliminate extreme values ​​by using the standard deviation.

The data is ready for predictive analysis.

## If you work with jupyter notebook, you must install the following libraries:

### pandas
### matplotlib.pyplot
### scipy
### sklearn
### seaborn
### statsmodels
